## 📌 What You’ll Be Doing

### 1️⃣ Complete the FreeCodeCamp Module  
- Go to **[FreeCodeCamp Functions Module](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript)**  
- Work through the exercises on **functions**  
- Use **console.log()** to test and understand the code  

### 2️⃣ Complete the JavaScript Challenge  
After finishing FreeCodeCamp, you’ll apply your knowledge in a **coding challenge**:  

- [ ] **Fork this repository**  
- [ ] **Download it using GitHub Desktop**  
- [ ] **Open the repo in VS Code**  
- [ ] **Read through all files (README + JavaScript files)**  
- [ ] **Install dependencies** (you’ll be using JavaScript & testing tools)  
- [ ] **Modify `functions.js` to complete the tasks**  
- [ ] **Run tests using `npm test`** to check your answers  
- [ ] **Fix any errors and re-run the tests until they all pass**  
- [ ] **Save, commit, push your changes, and share your repo link**

## 🚀 How to Get Started  

### 1️⃣ Clone & Setup the Repo  
- Fork this repo to your account
- Open **GitHub Desktop**  
- Clone this repo and open it in **VS Code**  
- Open the terminal and run:  
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```  

---

### 2️⃣ Complete `functions.js`
- Open `functions.js`
- Read the instructions inside the file
- Use `console.log()` to debug and check your work
- Modify the code to complete each task

---

### 3️⃣ Run Tests & Debug  
- Run the following command in the terminal:  
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```  
  - If tests fail, read the error messages, fix your code, and re-run the test  
- Once all tests pass, proceed to commit your work  

---

### 4️⃣ Console.log
1. push your console.logs to the terminal
2. open a new terminal, make sure you are in the right folder
3. run
```bash
node functions.js
```
4. this should give you results of your console.logs

---

### 5️⃣ Save, Commit & Push  
1. Go back to GitHub Desktop  
2. Review your changes under “Changes”  
3. Write a commit message (e.g., "Completed functions challenges")  
4. Click Commit to main  
5. Click Push origin
